# M5: AI assistant

**Needs:** [account setup](account-setup.md), and an answer to U-19.

**Outcome:** Amazon Bedrock explains results and proposes validated changes. Every other feature works with it off.

## Work

1. `feat/bedrock-client`: server-side client through the task role, with limits, prompt rules and failure handling.
2. `feat/ai-explain`: plain explanations of composition errors and impact results.
3. `feat/ai-suggest`: safe migrations, checked by real composition before they're shown.
4. `feat/ai-draft`: operations from a description, validated against the schema.

## Exit

- An invalid suggestion is never shown.
- An instruction planted in a schema comment or README changes nothing.
- With Bedrock blocked, all deterministic results still work.
